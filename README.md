## About Me
I am a Computer Science (AI) graduate with a strong foundation in Python, machine learning, and software development, with a focus on building practical, end-to-end systems.

I recently completed my final-year AI project, where I designed, trained, evaluated, and deployed a machine learning–based malware detection system using structured network traffic data. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and deployment as a Flask-based REST API for real-time inference.

Alongside my academic work, I completed an internship at Etisal Distribution, gaining exposure to IT operations, server room environments, and ERP systems.
